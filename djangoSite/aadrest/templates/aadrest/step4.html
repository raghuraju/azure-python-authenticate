	<h1> Multi-Tenant Azure AD REST AuthN Process - Organizational Account </h1>
	<h2> Step 4 </h2>
	
	Here are the names of the subscriptions that were returned in Step 3.  Following each subscription is the Tenant ID of the Azure AD tenant associated with it.  In my case I have two subscriptions associated with the same Azure AD tenant.  With that tenant ID in hand, the required access token may be fetched from Azure AD through a process very similar to the one we just completed, this time using the tenant ID instead of Common. <br><br>
